# Create Duplicating piped data with tee
## Code:
```bash
hacker@piping~duplicating-piped-data-with-tee:~$ /challenge/pwn | /challenge/college
Processing...
The input to 'college' does not contain the correct secret code! This code
should be provided by the 'pwn' command. HINT: use 'tee' to intercept the
output of 'pwn' and figure out what the code needs to be.
hacker@piping~duplicating-piped-data-with-tee:~$ /challenge/pwn | tee out | /challenge/college
Processing...

hacker@piping~duplicating-piped-data-with-tee:~$ cat out
Usage: /challenge/pwn --secret [SECRET_ARG]

SECRET_ARG should be "gRCWJ0VE"
hacker@piping~duplicating-piped-data-with-tee:~$ /challenge/pwn --secret gRCWJ0VE | /challenge/college
Processing...
Correct! Passing secret value to /challenge/college...
Great job! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{gRCWJ0VEIpcseyD00O0leBdA_Je.dFjM5QDL3kzN0czW}
